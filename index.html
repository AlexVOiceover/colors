                    <h2>Vigo</h2>
                    <p>I spent in Vigo the first 18 years of my life. It was here where, at the age of 12, I attended my inaugural coding classes. My perception forever changed, I finally understood that machines were not impenetrable boxes of mystery, but entities I could converse with.<br> Simultaneously, I was also engrossed in studying music, specifically piano and singing. All these elements would later interweave significantly, shaping my future in ways I could hardly have anticipated.</p>

                    <h2>London</h2>
                    <p>My initial stay in London was incredible, marking my first experience in a foreign country. I had the opportunity to engage with several recording studios, which ignited my passion for sound engineering. My prior experience in IT was less than thrilling, so I gradually, and without a concrete plan, began transitioning from IT to sound engineering and voice acting.</p>
