                    <h2>Vigo</h2>
                    <p>I spent in Vigo the first 18 years of my life. It was here where, at the age of 12, I attended my inaugural coding classes. My perception forever changed, I finally understood that machines were not impenetrable boxes of mystery, but entities I could converse with.<br> Simultaneously, I was also engrossed in studying music, specifically piano and singing. All these elements would later interweave significantly, shaping my future in ways I could hardly have anticipated.</p>

                    <h2>London</h2>
                    <p>My initial stay in London was incredible, marking my first experience in a foreign country. I had the opportunity to engage with several recording studios, which ignited my passion for sound engineering. My prior experience in IT was less than thrilling, so I gradually, and without a concrete plan, began transitioning from IT to sound engineering and voice acting.</p>

                    <p>I fondly recall my time in Amsterdam. Although it was a brief period, just under two years, I enjoyed a tranquil and intellectually enriching life there. I worked for IDFA, a documentary festival, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the entire media production process. Concurrently, my studio continued to improve, as did my sound engineering skills.</p>

                    <p>I spent just under a year traveling through Australia. During this time, I didn't engage in IT or sound engineering work, but instead took on temporary jobs here and there. This journey significantly broadened my perspective, a process that began in Amsterdam and reached its peak in Australia. The trip greatly enhanced my understanding of myself and others. It taught me to value friendships that have a finite lifespan and to appreciate the simplicity of life.</p>

                    <p>Back to London, my voice acting career took off, and I mastered sound engineering. Now, at the midpoint of my life, I feel less compelled to discover new things and more driven to apply what I've learned. I believe that magic happens at the intersections of knowledge fields, or when you merge technologies that weren't initially designed to work together. To provide a platform for my skills to interact and grow, I need to return to my roots, the place where all my interests converge: software development.</p>

                    <p>I fell in love with motorbikes when I was a child, some of the great Spanish MotoGP riders were my heroes. I got my first bike at 16, and I always had one until I left Spain at the age of 25. This picture is from a race in France.</p>

                    <p>Coffee machines, game consoles, clothes, fountain pens, glasses, microphones... and straight razors, like the one in the picture. Giving objects a second life is extremely rewarding for me and it's the best way to understand how things work, and more importantly, to develop skills that you can transfer to other unexpected fields.</p>

                    <p>There will always be a very special place in my heart for Origami. My cousin taught me the most basic figures and after that, I studied different techniques and styles. From something as humble as a piece of paper, you can create stunning sculptures. It also helps you to be precise; a small imperfection in the early stages will translate into horrible final results.</p>

Despite only occupying a few hours of my week, it's where I truly excel. I am well aware of my limitations and wouldn't dare claim proficiency in any other job. However, I can assert, with a sense of pride, that I am really good at voice acting. The picture I've chosen holds a special significance for me - it's the very studio where the dialogues for "Half Life" were recorded.</p>

                    <h2>Sound Engineering</h2>
                    <p>My sentiments towards sound engineering mirror those I have for voice acting. Even though it's my primary source of income, the enjoyment I derive from it makes it feel more like a hobby than a job. I thrive on a blend of artistic and technical activities in my daily life. Sound engineering provides a perfect excuse to be immersed in a world of fascinating machinery and cutting-edge technology. It also serves as an excellent platform to hone my communication skills. A recording studio can often be a high-stress environment, so it's crucial to know how to interact with a variety of people while maintaining productivity.</p>

                    <p>Music also plays a vital role in my life. My musical journey, which spanned over 12 years, involved dedicated study of piano and singing. Although I never excelled particularly in either, the vocal techniques I acquired were invaluable to my voice acting career. My stay in San Sebasti√°n allowed me the opportunity to participate in several African percussion bands. This picture encapsulates a memorable performance at an opera in Bilbao.</p>
