#  My Personal Journey - A Website
This website is a simple introduction to who I am, beyond just being a student. I've always thought that a person is defined best by their choices, especially personal ones. So, what could be more personal than the places we choose as our homes and the hobbies we entertain?

In creating this online space, my idea was to take you on a short journey through some of the places I've lived, and a quick peek at a selection of my hobbies. I've intentionally left out the ones more related to coding - like my home assistant projects, drone building, 3D printer assembly, and so on. I feel that these are better shared and understood in person, during meetings.

The idea was to keep things straightforward. I initially wanted the site to focus entirely on pictures and short descriptions, without any JavaScript. But to be honest, I had to add a bit of JS towards the end. You'll find an example of my technical skills in a game I put together, which you can check out here: https://alexvoiceover.github.io/Game3/index.html

## Building The Site
I wanted to share a visual tour of the different countries I've lived in using photographs. To make the adventure a little more engaging, I settled on creating an image carousel - a popular structure you've likely come across before.

And just to style things up a bit, I included a appealing divider. But don't worry - the main intent behind it all was to use these elements to narrate my story in a compelling way.

On the mobile version I removed the navigation arrows for simplicity. Just giving to the user a glipse of the next picture is enought to let them know that they can scroll horizontally.

Enjoy the trip!
